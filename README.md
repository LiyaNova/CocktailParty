# CocktailParty 

App created with SwiftUI and [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) API.

**Stack**: SwiftUI, WidgetKit, MVVM, Coordinator, URLSession, 

**Notes**:
The API has limitations in terms of data output and complexity in the structure of objects. Therefore, the objects provided by the API are
initialized into more suitable models.
Features, that I wanted to implement, but this turned out to be impossible, due to the API limitations are marked (*)
and implemented exclusively at the frontend.

**Features**:
- Ability to select the type of cocktail party depending on the category: alcoholic, non-alcoholic, random
- Animation of the main screen based on changing the parameters of graphic elements
- Screen with a cocktails collection based on LazyVGrid
- (*) Ability to like a favorite cocktail (mock of adding to favorites)
- Detail screen with information about a cocktail
- Widget that makes a daily api call and displays the “Cocktail of the Day”
- App is based on a dark theme
